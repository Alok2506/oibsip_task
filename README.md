# Task 1: EDA on Retail Sales Data

# Objective

The goal of this task is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. This analysis helps in understanding the sales performance, customer behavior, and identifying potential areas for improvement.

# Key Steps
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics to understand the central tendency and distribution of sales data.

Visualization: Creating various plots (histograms, bar charts, line charts) to visualize sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between different variables such as sales, customer segments, and product categories.

# Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook for executing and documenting the analysis.

# Task 2: Wine Quality Prediction

# Objective

This task involves building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The aim is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify wines into quality categories.

# Key Steps

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering features that most significantly affect wine quality.

Model Selection: Training multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and comparing their performance.

Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model to improve its accuracy and generalization.

# Tools & Technologies

Python

Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.

Pandas and NumPy for data processing.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

# Task 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis

# Objective

The purpose of this task is to perform customer segmentation to identify distinct customer groups within a dataset. This analysis helps in tailoring marketing strategies to different customer segments for better targeting.

# Key Steps

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the customer data.

Feature Scaling: Normalizing data to ensure fair clustering.

Clustering Algorithms: Applying clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers.

Cluster Profiling: Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster to understand the different customer segments.

Visualization: Visualizing the clusters using 2D/3D plots and interpreting the results.

# Tools & Technologies
